Specifications:

1. 2 Turtles will move in a single ROS TurtleSim window.

2. All turtles should start moving simultaneously (ignore slight drifts).

3. The motion of the first turtle proceeds in rounds; round-1, round-2, and round-3. The turtle stops
moving after it executes 3 rounds. Consider that the starting directions of the turtle in these
rounds are as follows: Right, Right, and Left. After the turtle completes its movement in a
direction, it moves 0.2 units down, and returns back to its initial location. If the previous direction
of the turtle is the same as its current direction, the turtle increases the distance it travels by one
unit in the next round; otherwise, it doubles its distance in the next round. For example: For the
“Right, Right, and Left” directions of the turtle; the turtle moves 1 unit right in round=1, 2 units
right in round=2, and 4 units left in round=3.

4. The motion of the second turtle also proceeds in rounds; round-1, round-2, …., round-5. The turtle
stops moving after it executes 5 rounds. In each round, the turtle draws a half circle. The radius
of each half circle up to round-5 is as follows: 1.0, 1.6, 2.2 , 2.8, and 3.4. You can change the values
as long as you maintain the concentric half circles motion pattern that the turtle follows.

5. Each turtle should always face the direction it moves.

6. You should create one python node to control turtle1 and a separate python node to control
turtle2.
